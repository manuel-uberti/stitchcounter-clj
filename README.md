# stitchcounter-clj

Command line tool to help you with knitting and crocheting.

It is a porting in Clojure of the same program I wrote in C: [stitchcounter.c](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/c-bag/blob/master/stitchcounter.c)

## Usage
Clone this repo and run ```stitch-counter``` from the command line.
