# stitchcounter-clj

Command line tool to help you with knitting and crocheting.

It is a porting in Clojure of the same program I wrote in C: [stitchcounter.c](https://github.com/manuel-uberti/c-bag/blob/master/stitchcounter.c)

I created the executable using [lein-bin](https://github.com/Raynes/lein-bin).

## Prerequisites
This tool needs the Java Runtime Environment to run. Download and install the correct JRE for your OS.

Check everything is working with the command:
```
java -version
```

## Usage
Clone this repo and run ```stitch-counter``` from the command line. You will be presented with two options:
- Calculate stitches from original gauge
- Calculate stitches from dimensions

Pick your option and follow the instructions.
